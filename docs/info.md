## How it works

It's just a little test project connecting some inputs to outputs via 4 logic gates. The outputs are wired to the 7-segment display.

## How to test

Just enable either input 3 or input 5 and the 7-segment display displays a letter. Input 7 causes the display to show the dot.

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
